## Back to ```lower_bound()```

* So ```lower_bound()``` was something like ```partitionPoint()``` in STL
* Let's rewrite a find function with iterators

```{cpp}
template <typename Iter, typename T>
Iter find(Iter first, Iter last, const T& v) {
	for (; first != last; ++first) {
		if (*first == v)
			return first;
	}
	return last;
	}
}
```

* The cool thing: there's literally zero overhead for templating
* This is *the* optimal implementation of ```find()``` for every type that has an iterator, with just one single implementation
* The compiler replaces the fuction calls (e.g. ++, !=, *) with the functions defined for Iter inline
* That is, it's compiled to the same code as an ad-hoc find function for each class would be

## Back to graph

* Fundamental problem with graph class: don't need to look up edges random access
* Let's deprecate ```Edge edge(int i)```
* In C++14, could tag with [[deprecated]]. But not C++11, so just use a comment to specify it's deprecated.
* We do want a fast iterator, but don't need to get any particular edge randomly
* In HW1, we'll build node iterators, edge iterators, and incidence iterators (iterate over all edges incident to a node)
* Also want to update ```draw_graph()``` to be agnostic to ```Graph```

## Iterator fanciness

* Our goal was to abstract a find function for an arbitrary container
* But now ```find()``` doesn't refer to containers at all. The pair of iterators stands in for a container of values. The container doesn't have to exist.

```{cpp}
class int_enumerator {
	int n_;
	public:
		int_enumerator(int n) : n_(n) {}
		bool operator==(const int_enumerator& ie) const {
			return n_ == ie.n_; 
		}
		int operator*() {return n_;}
		int_enumerator& operator++() {
			++n_;
			return *this;
		}
};

int main() {
	auto i = find(int_enumerator(3), int_enumerator(55), 43);
}
```

* So now we're using two iterators to represent a container that doesn't even exist. Nothing is stored in memory except the two iterators themselves.
* This is how Python's ```xrange()``` works
* STL has the function below

```{cpp}
template <typename Iter1, Iter2, Pred>
Iter2 copy_if(Iter1 first, Iter1 last, Iter2 out, Pred pred) {
	while (first != last) {
		if (pred(*first)) {
			*out = *first;
			++out;
		}
		++first;
	}
	return out;
}

int main() {
	std::vector<int> v(100000);
	// Fill v with all prime numbers between 2 and 100000
	// More efficient than generating all integers and filtering some out
	// But v is too large
	copy_if(int_enumerator(2), int_enumerator(100000), v.begin(), is_prime());
}
```

* Preconditions: valid ```Iter1``` iterator range, ```Iter2``` needs enough space to hold everything
* Alternative way without initializing ```v``` would be to loop over integers and ```push_back(i)``` when we hit a prime
* Need to handle ```push_back()``` inside ```copy_if()``` somehow
* Idea is that we always point to back of container

```{cpp}
// Template on a container that supports push_back()
// Abstractly knows where the last place in the container is
// Could template the type of the container too, but only write to push ints for now
template<typename Container>
class back_inserter {
	Container& a_;
	public:
		// Don't really need comparison for copy_if(), but write one for good measure
		bool operator==(const back_inserter& bi) const {
			return &a_ == &(bi.a_);
		}
		// If we increment, still point to end.
		// Compiler will erase the increment line in copy_if() when we bind to a back_inserter() 
		back_inserter& operator++() {return *this;}
		back_inserter& operator*() {return *this;}
		// Overload assignment to actually do push_back()
		back_inserter& operator=(int i) {
			a_.push_back(i);
			return *this;
		}
}

int main() {
	std::vector<int> v;
	auto bi = back_inserter<>(v);
	// bi = 2; => v.push_back(2);
	copy_if(int_enumerator(2), int_enumerator(100000), bi, is_prime());
}
```

* So now, ```copy_if()``` does the same thing as that loop above
* Could use an ```ostream``` iterator to forward it to print on the screen
