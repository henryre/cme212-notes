## Reading

* Avoid state machines
* Separate data structures and algorithm
* Blah blah

## Live coding

* Use profiling to speed things up
    * Add flags in makefile
    ```{make}
    ifdef PROFILE
    	CXX := g++
    	CXXFLAGS += -g -pg
    endif
    ```
    ```
    make mass_spring PROFILE=1
    ```
    * The file ```gmon.out``` gets produced, and we read it with
    ```gprof mass_spring gmon.out > ms_log.txt```
    * This is only top level, since the compiler did so much work for us at ```-O3```. It constructs a mega function (```symp_euler_step```) with everything mixed in. Let's try ```-O2```.
    ```{make}
    ifdef PROFILE
    	CXX := g++
    	CXXFLAGS += -g -pg -O2 // Compiler only listens to last O flag
    endif
    ```
    ```
    make mass_spring PROFILE=1
    ```
    * Really only pulled out ```norm``` which we can't do much about. Let's try ```-O0```. It's crazy slow.
    * The problem: ```edge::value()```. Let's optimize it.
    * ```std::lower_bound()``` doesn't help since degrees are small
    * ```unordered_map``` won't really speed anything up
    * Keep ```edge_value_type```s in a ```std::vector``` and assign a uid to each edge (which indexes the vector). ```Edge```s store the uid. Could either get it by ```std::find()``` on adjacency list, or pass it in the constructor. 
    * New RI is that the edge uid is the same uid held in the adjacency list entries

* Cris' graph
    * Use ```std::make_tuple()``` and ```std::tie()``` to do comparisons
    * Allow ```edge_internal``` comparison and casts to uids (for ```std::find```)
    * No index in ```edge_internal```
    * Use tons of ```assert```s to check invariants, then kill them out with the compiler using ```-DNDEBUG```
