## A little more inheritance

* `totally_ordered<>` was CRPT behind the scenes
* It also uses some cool other C++ features
* `totally_ordered` also inherits from `less_than_comparable` and `inequality_comparable`
* In the following example, `A` ISA `B` and `A` ISA `C`
```{cpp}
class A {
	// ...
};
class B {
	// ...
};

class C : public A, public B {
	// ...
}
```
* This is controversial. There may be conflicting data members or function members between `A` and `B`
```{cpp}
virtual void A::foo() {
	// ...
}
virtual void B::foo() {
	// ...
}
C c;
c.foo(); // What happens?
```
* The last line is undefined behavior. The compiler may or may not say something.
* One way to fix this is to do 
```{cpp}
void C::foo() { A::foo(); }
```
* There may be a fundamental way to refactor your classes if you start running into scenarios like these
* For a "dreaded diamond" pattern (e.g. `A` and `B` both inherit from `X`), then members of `X` are duplicated in memory (if we access `A::y` or `B::y` where `y` is a data member of `X`)
* We can use virtual inheritance to get around this
```{cpp}
class A : virtual public X {
	// ...	
};
class B : virtual public X {
	// ...
}
```
* Avoid this if you can in regular sized code bases
* Good practice today: templates for inheritance, compostition for code reuse. Don't use inheritance for both
