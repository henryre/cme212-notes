## OOP in CPP

* Abstraction of iterators let's us do crazy things with STL and have it operate like we wrote ad-hoc code
* Some non-statically typed languages (e.g. Python) have this to some extent
* General theme of separating data and algorithms (e.g. LaTeX separating content from style)
* Orthogonal concerns: algorithm stays the same even when we change design of data structure

## One last bit of iterators (on ```partition_point()```)

This is the STL implementation of the algorithm
```{cpp}
template <typename Iter, typename Pred>
Iter partition_point(Iter first, Iter last, Pred pred) {
	auto n = std::distance(first, last)
	while (n > 0) {
		auto step = n/2;
		Iter it = first;
		std::advance(first, n);
		if (pred(*first)) {
			first = ++it;
			n -= step + 1;
		}
		else
			n = step;
	}
	return first;
}
```

* We implemented iterators with increment, dereference, and compare
* These are the minimum set of operations needed to define a ```ForwardIterator```
* **ForwardIterator**: ```++p```, ```p==q```, ```*p```
* **BidirectionalIterator**: ForwardIterator plus ```--p```
* **RandomAccessIterator**: BidirectionalIterator plus ```p+i``` (which also gives ```p[3]=*(p+3)=3[p]```, but never use that last one) and ```p < q```
* So now we have a hierarchy of iterator concepts
* ```partition_point()``` is implemented such that we can optimize it for any concept using ```std::distance``` and ```std::advance```
    * RandomAccessIterator: distance is ```p-q``` and advance is ```p+n```
    * ForwardIterator: distance is ```int n = 0; for ( ; first != last, ++first) ++n;``` and advance is ```for ( ; n > 0; --n) ++first;```
* So what's in an iterator?
```{cpp}
typedef
    value_type
    pointer_type
    reference_type
    difference_type
    iterator_category
```

* Another example: ```std::copy```. Takes iterators, but if it can use ```memcpy``` from C rather than generic for loop based on data type, it will because it's crazy fast.
* Ok so let's see ```std::advance``` using the typedef ```iter_category``` to determine which concept class it is

```{cpp}
// Dumb tags for dispatching iterators
struct forward_iterator_tag {};
struct bidirectional_iterator_tag : forward_iterator_tag {};
struct random_access_iterator_tag : bidirectional_iterator_tag {};
// Tag pointers as random_access_iteror_tag by template specialization
// Acts like an if statement inside compiler
template <typename Iter>
struct iterator_traits {
	typedef typename Iter::iterator_category iterator_category;
}
template <typename T>
struct iterator_traits<T*> {
	typedef random_access_iterator_tag iterator_category;
}
void advance(Iter& it, int n) {
	typename iterator_traits<Iter>::iterator_category tag;
	advance(it, n, tag);

}
// Handles both ForwardIterator and BidirectionIterator
// The tag does nothing except specify the function signature we want to use
// We don't even need to give a value in the tag
void advance(Iter it, int n, forward_iterator_tag) {
	for (; n > 0; n--)
		++it;
}
// Compiler prioritizes calling the function with a "better fit" signature
// (e.g. no casting to parent type)
void advance(Iter it, int n, random_access_iterator_tag) {
	it += n;
}
```

* This dispatching technique is common. Let's us use a common interface but optimizes for different types.
