## Preview of next week

* We haven't been doing OOP yet, since OOP deals with relationships between objects
* Dynamic polymorphism sucks. Static polymorphism doesn't.
* More on this next week

## A bit on ```const```

Vectors need two ```op[]()```s

```{cpp}
template<T>
struct vector {
	T& op[](int i);
	const T& op[](int i) const;
}

int main() {
	const vector<int> a;
	// Can only use const operations with a, unless we use const_cast()
}
```

* ```const``` is a propagated trait throughout our code, and doing something like ```const_cast``` to mutate and immutable object violates const-correctness.
* We do some violation for Graphs. Forget why we do it.

## Scientific computing

* We have a lot of values expressed as ```double```
    * Force
    * Mass
    * Length
    * Time
    * Velocity
* It would be nice if our program didn't compile if we tried to do F=mv instead of F=ma
* We could start typing this and overloading operators
```{cpp}
struct Force {
	double f;
}
Force operator*(Mass m, Acceleration a);
Mass operator+(Mass m1, Mass m2);
// ...
```

* But there are so many of these!
* Let's go to fundamental units and count exponents


| **Unit**      | **Mass**      | **Length**|**Time** |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :--------:|:-------:|
| Force      | 1 | 1 | -2  |
| Mass      | 1      |   0 | 0    |
| Length | 0     |    1 |  0     |
| Time | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| Velocity | 0 | 1 | -1 |
| Acceleration | 0 | 1 | -2 |

* Let's encode the units in a templated object

```{cpp}
template <int M, int L, int T>
struct Unit {
	double v_;
}

typedef Unit<1,1,-2> Force;
typedef Unit<0,1,0> Length;
// ...

// Addition needs to be on same type
template <int M, int L, int T>
Unit<M,L,T> operator+(Unit<M,L,T> u1, Unit<M,L,T> u2) {
	return {u1.v_ + u2.v_};
}

// Template math for other ops
template <int M1, int L1, int T1, int M2, int L2, int T2>
Unit<M1+M2, L1+L2, T1+T2> operator*(Unit<M1,L1,T1> u1, Unit<M2,L2,T2> u2) {
	return {u1.v_ * u2.v_};
}
```

* All of this template computation HAPPENS AT COMPILE TIME. That's cool.
* Only the dynamic calculations done by the program is left for run time. That is, this approach has zero overhead.
* We're programming the compiler, not programming the program.
* This is probably overkill for HW2 though.
