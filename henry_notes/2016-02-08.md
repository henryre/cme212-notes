## Modularity in HW2

* Goal is to modularize forces and constraints in mass spring model
* Separate Problem 1 force into
    * Gravity force
    * Spring force
    * Damping force
* A force is a mapping f : (n,t) â†’ ```Point()```, i.e. any function object that implements the following is a force that we can pass to the integrator
```{cpp}
Point operator()(Node n, double t);
```
* We want to combine forces at points, so could do
```{cpp}
template<F1, F2>
struct CombinedForce {
	F1 f1;
	F2 f2;
	Point operator()(Node n, double t) {
		return f1(n, t) + f2(n, t);
    }
}
CombinedForce make_combined_force(F1 f1, F2 f2);
CombinedForce make_combined_force(F1 f1, F2 f2, F3 f2) {
	F_ f = make_combined_force(f1, f2);
	return make_combined_force(f, f3);
}
```
* This function takes two forces, which are functions, and returns another force (which is also a function). Getting into functional programming.

## Random stuff in C++ on class design

* Classes are used to maintain relationships between data. These are our representation invariants.
* One instance of this is memory allocation. Here's a simple thing that handles memory like an STL container.

```{cpp}
class dyn_memory {
    T* a_;
  public:
	dyn_array(int n) {
		// malloc/new
	}
	~dyn_array() {
		// free/delete
	}
}
```

* The idea of turning allocation into declaration is very general. It's called **RAII** (resource allocation *is* initialization).
* These aren't RI's exactly, but they're linked concepts in a similar way.
* The ```lock()/release()``` paradigm for mutex's is used in a similar way as ```malloc()/free()``` or ```new/delete```. The graph viewer uses a **guard pattern** like this.
* Python's ```with open()``` does this via scoping

### Iterator ranges
* An example is when we pass two iterators and pre-condition that they're a valid range. We should probably just wrap them in a range object.
* The begin to end iterator for loop is such a common idiom, C++ allows
```{cpp}
std::vector<int> v;
for(int a : v) {
	// ...
}
```
* This replaces the lengthy
```{cpp}
auto it_end = v.end();
for (auto it = v.begin(); it != it_end; ++it) {
	int a = *it;
	// ...
}
```
* So now we can define a concept
```{cpp}
concept Range {
	Iterator begin();
	Iterator end();
}
```
* This won't quite work for Graph, since we have things like ```node_begin()``` instead of ```begin()```.
* We want
```{cpp}
for (auto n : g) //for (Node n : g);
for (auto e : g) //for (Edge e : g);
```
* This is literally the same code, but we need to disambiguate between nodes and edges. We never disambiguate with return types, by the way.
* The thing on the RHS (```g```) needs to fulfill the range concept.
* So it needs to implement ```begin()``` and ```end()``` which correspond to ```node_begin()/end()``` or ```edge_begin()/end()```
* Nice. This tells us what we need to do.
```{cpp}
template<class Graph>
struct NodeRange {
	Graph& g;
	Graph::node_iterator begin() {
		return g.node_begin();
	}
	Graph::node_iterator end() {
		return g.node_end();
	}
};

template <typename V, typename E>
NodeRange<Graph<V,E>> nodes(Graph<V, E>& g) {
	return {g}; // Shortcut for construction with one member variable
}
// Same for EdgeRange...
for (auto n : nodes(g));
for (auto e : edges(g));
```
* This has no overhead. The compiler literally translates it exactly to the for loop paradigm.
* This is called an **adapter pattern**. It provides a different interface to the same type.
