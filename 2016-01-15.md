# CME 212 Notes

## 2016-01-15

* HW0 due
* HW1 out, due in 2 weeks
* EX0 out, due in 1 week

Today:

* brief intro to HW1
* discuss representation

## HW1

* Extending `Graph`, `Node`, and `Edge` to do cool stuff
* Read the whole document before starting work on the code.  Specifically,
  consider `incident_iterator` before you go and implement
  `{node,edge}_iterator`.
* Start early.  Compile early, compile often.  Commit early, commit often.
* Read section *3.4 Introducing Iterators* in *C++ Primer*
* Good idea to also start looking at *Chapter 10: Generic Algorithms*.  Generic
  algorithms in STL make use of iterators returned from standard containers.  We
  would like these algorithms to also work with containers we define.
* Cris will discuss iterators in class next week.

## EX1

* Written exercises.
* We will post submission instructions on Piazza.  This will likely involve
  creating a folder in your `submit` repo and pushing to GitHub.
  
## Representation (of Edges)

Recall that an abstract (undirected) graph is a pair $G = \langle N, E\rangle$,
where $E$ is a set of unordered pairs of nodes: $e \in E \Rightarrow e =
\{n_i,n_j\}$ where $n_i,n_j\in N$ and $n_i\neq n_j$.

### NWH Solution (v1)

Single `Edge` representation:

```c++
class Graph
  class Edge
    const Graph* graph_
    size_type id1_
    size_type id2_
```

Graph representation:

```c++
class Graph
  vector<Point> points_
  vector<Edge> edges_
```

What are the issues?  Consider:

* `add_node` (required `O(1)`)
* `add_edge` (required `O(num_nodes() + num_edges())`)
* `node(i)`  (required `O(1)`)
* `edge(i)`  (required `O(num_nodes() + num_edges())`)

### Other possible representations?

There are many:

* Dense matrix, maybe `vector<vector<bool>>`
* Dense vector, maybe `vector<bool>`
* Adjacency vectors, maybe `vector<vector<int>>`
* Ordered `set` of pairs of node indices
* we can come up with others

### Dense matrix

* Have to resize everything on addition of node.
* What would iterating through edges look like?

### Dense vector

* Where would indicator for edge $\{n_i,n_j\}$ reside in the vector?
* How to resize on addition of node?

### Adjacency representation

* Consider symmetry
* What about ordering on the second level?

### Ordered `set`

* `insert` complexity?
* `find` complexity?
* How to iterate?
